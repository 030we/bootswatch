Bootswatch
==========

Bootswatch is a library of themed swatches for use with [Twitter Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/). It allows the time-constrained and design-impaired to give their Bootstrap sites a splash of color without having to open a color picker.

Use
-----
Browse the swatches at http://www.bootswatch.com.

Download the `bootstrap.css` file from the swatch of your choice and replace the one in Bootstrap.

Extend
------
Swatches are created in [LESS](http://lesscss.org/). Modifications are made to `variables.less` and introduced with `bootswatch.less`.

You are welcome to fork the files from this repository and customize them further.

Feedback
------
Please send feedback to feedback@bootswatch.com.
