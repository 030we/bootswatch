Bootswatch
==========

Bootswatch is a library of themed swatches for use with [Twitter Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/). It allows the time-constrained and design-impaired to give their Bootstrap sites a splash of color without having to open a color picker.

Use
-----
Visit http://bootswatch.com.

Replace Bootstrap's default `bootstrap.min.css` file with the one from your chosen swatch.

Extend
------
Swatches are created in [LESS](http://lesscss.org/). Modifications are made to the existing `variables.less` and with the addition of `bootswatch.less`.

The files can be found in the `gh-pages` branch. You are welcome to fork the files and modify them further.

Feedback
------
Please send bugs, submissions, and other feedback to feedback@bootswatch.com.
